## My personal repository of examples for NextJs applications.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app --exemple (https://github.com/viniciusram2025/next---exemple)`](https://github.com/viniciusram2025/next---exemple).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Presettings

In this example we have the settings for:

- Eslint - `.eslint.js`
- Prettier - `.prettierrc.js`
- Jest - `jest.config.js`
- Babel - `.babelrc`
- Storybook - `.storybook`

There is also a components folder with an example component and files:

- `index.jsx` - example index file.
- `stories.jsx` - stories archive already configured and working.
- `styles.js` - styles with Styled-Components already ready for writing.
- `CloneMe.test.jsx` - a file for testing in Jest already with the index.js file test ready.
